Welcome to the **Dynamic Resume Builder** project, part of Milestone 3. This project involves creating a dynamic resume builder where users can input their personal details through a form, and a resume is generated based on their inputs. The project uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **TypeScript**.

## Features

- **Interactive Form**: Users can enter information such as personal details, education, work experience, and skills.
- **Dynamic Resume Generation**: Upon submission, a resume is dynamically generated and displayed on the same page.
- **Colorful and Responsive Design**: The resume is styled to be visually appealing and responsive across various screen sizes.
- **Profile Picture Upload**: Users can upload a profile picture that will be shown in the generated resume.

## Technologies Used
